Word Search Kata (KataSearch)

This project reads a text file containing a list of words
and a square grid of characters, both comma-delimited. See the 
included sample "trek.txt" for reference.

Run the main method in the WordSearchMain class. When prompted,
enter the file name of the puzzle you'd like to process. (Any
such files should be placed in the main project directory.) 

You can process as many such puzzles as you like. Enter "q" at 
the prompt to exit the program.
